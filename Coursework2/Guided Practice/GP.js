// This is a guided practice for the students to practice arrays and objects in JavaScript.
// The students are given an array of students with their names, ages, and favorite subjects
// and are asked to write a console log that reads "Megan is 16 and likes math".
// The students are also given a hint to use the index of the array to access the values.
const students = [['Joe', 'Megan', 'April'], [17,16,18], ["math", "english", "math"]]

//write a console that reads Megan is 16 and likes nath using the array above


const nameArray = ['Joe', 'Megan', 'April']
const ageArray = [17, 16, 18]
const subjectArray = ['math', 'english', 'math']
console.log(subjectArray[2])
console.log(`${students[0]} is ${students[1]} and likes ${students[2]}`)
